Fourier Cross Correlation
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of Fourier Transforms for performing cross-correlation between signals. The approach significantly improves computational efficiency for large signals and is widely used in signal processing, image analysis, and time-series analysis.

üìì Notebook: Fourier_cross_corelation.ipynb
üß† Key Concepts
Fourier Transform (FFT): Converts time-domain signals into frequency-domain representations.

Cross-Correlation: Measures the similarity between two signals as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other.

FFT-based Cross-Correlation: Uses the convolution theorem to compute cross-correlation via FFT, which is more efficient than direct computation.

üîß Dependencies
